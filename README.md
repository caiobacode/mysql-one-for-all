## Description
<p>In this project, I had to create a database called SpotifyClone and its tables from scratch, and then make 10 custom queries, some counting how many times a song was played, others counting how many users pay for the personal plan.

<strong>✏️ What i learned</strong>

- Utilize INNER JOIN to connect different tables in one query.
- Utilize Group By is group records from a table based on one or more columns and apply aggregate functions to these groups.
- Utilize Order By to sort the results of a query in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns of the table.
